<current_state>
Phase 89 (Platform Polish) is complete and verified. Phase 90 (Distribution) has not been planned yet — planning was started but user interrupted to do manual Linux testing first.

The Linux tar.gz build already exists and is ready for upload:
- `E:\arcboundinteractive\dist\downloads\AC-Map-Editor-1.1.2-linux-x64.tar.gz`

User is uploading the dist folder via FileZilla to arcboundinteractive.com, then downloading on their Linux laptop to test. The link will be:
`https://arcboundinteractive.com/dist/downloads/AC-Map-Editor-1.1.2-linux-x64.tar.gz`
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 88 (Build Architecture): Complete — platform.ts, cross-platform build scripts, tar.gz Linux build
- Phase 89 (Platform Polish): Complete and verified — menu & accelerators, XDG path docs, AppImage relaunch wiring
- Linux tar.gz copied to arcboundinteractive dist/downloads/ for upload
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- User: Upload dist folder via FileZilla, download tar.gz on Linux laptop, test the app
- User: On Linux laptop, run `npm run electron:build:linux` to produce actual AppImage + latest-linux.yml
- Phase 90: Plan and execute — GitHub Release with both platform assets, website download card, workflow docs
- After phase 90: Complete milestone v1.1.2-linux
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- tar.gz is the interim Linux build (produced from Windows); AppImage requires Linux host to build
- No public links yet — user uploads to known URL for private testing
- Phase 90 planning deferred until Linux testing confirms the build works
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- AppImage packaging requires Linux host — user must run `npm run electron:build:linux` on their laptop
- Phase 90 planning depends on successful Linux test results
</blockers>

<context>
The v1.1.2-linux milestone is 2/3 phases done. Code is complete for all platform polish. The remaining work is distribution (phase 90) which is mostly non-code: creating a GitHub Release, updating the website HTML with a Linux download card, and documenting the dual-platform release workflow. But first the user wants to verify the Linux build actually works on real hardware before publishing anything.

<next_action>
After Linux testing: `/gsd:plan-phase 90` to plan distribution, then `/gsd:execute-phase 90` to execute.
