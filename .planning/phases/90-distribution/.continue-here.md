<current_state>
Phase 89 (Platform Polish) is complete and verified. Phase 90 (Distribution) has not been planned yet.

User has downloaded the Linux tar.gz from the website and is testing on their Linux laptop.
Download URL: `https://arcboundinteractive.com/downloads/AC-Map-Editor-1.1.2-linux-x64.tar.gz`
(Note: dist/ is the web root — URLs are /downloads/... not /dist/downloads/...)

Both Windows and Linux builds are live on the site for private testing (no public download cards yet).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 88 (Build Architecture): Complete — platform.ts, cross-platform build scripts, tar.gz Linux build
- Phase 89 (Platform Polish): Complete and verified — menu & accelerators, XDG path docs, AppImage relaunch wiring
- Linux tar.gz uploaded to arcboundinteractive.com via FileZilla
- User downloaded tar.gz on Linux laptop — testing in progress
- public/downloads/ and dist/downloads/ synced (both have Windows exe + Linux tar.gz)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- User: Test Linux tar.gz build on laptop
- User: On Linux laptop, run `npm run electron:build:linux` to produce actual AppImage + latest-linux.yml
- Phase 90: Plan and execute — GitHub Release with both platform assets, website download card, workflow docs
- After phase 90: Complete milestone v1.1.2-linux
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- tar.gz is the interim Linux build (produced from Windows); AppImage requires Linux host to build
- No public download cards yet — user uploads to known URL for private testing
- Phase 90 planning deferred until Linux testing confirms the build works
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- AppImage packaging requires Linux host — user must run `npm run electron:build:linux` on their laptop
- Phase 90 planning depends on successful Linux test results
</blockers>

<context>
The v1.1.2-linux milestone is 2/3 phases done. Code is complete for all platform polish. The remaining work is distribution (phase 90) which is mostly non-code: creating a GitHub Release, updating the website HTML with a Linux download card, and documenting the dual-platform release workflow. User is testing the Linux build on real hardware first.

<next_action>
After Linux testing: `/gsd:plan-phase 90` to plan distribution, then `/gsd:execute-phase 90` to execute.
