# Phase 92 Plan 02: Format=1.1 Ordering — SKIPPED

**Skipped — SETT-02 triage in Plan 92-01 confirmed the bug was a non-issue (user didn't scroll in SEdit description box). All 53 settings serialize correctly at 871 chars.**

No code changes needed. Format=1.1 at position 0 does not cause any functional problems.
