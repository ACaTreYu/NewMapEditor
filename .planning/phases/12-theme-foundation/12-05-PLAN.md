<objective>
Visual verification that the Win98 theme foundation is correctly applied. Launch the application and verify all 5 phase success criteria are met.

Purpose: Catch any visual issues, missing purges, or broken variable references before marking Phase 12 complete.

Output: Verification pass/fail with issue list if any.

  <what-built>
    Complete Win98 theme foundation:
    - Win98 CSS variable system with 24 system colors and semantic aliases
    - Bevel utility classes (raised, sunken, etched, field, well)
    - MS Sans Serif bitmap font bundled and applied
    - Three Win98 color schemes (Standard, High Contrast, Desert)
    - Theme toggle repurposed from dark/light to Win98 schemes
    - All modern CSS artifacts purged (border-radius, transitions, rgba, opacity, filter)
    - Ghost CSS variables (--border-color, --accent-color) replaced
    - Canvas area with sunken well treatment
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run `npm run electron:dev` to launch the application
    2. Verify GREY BACKGROUND: All surfaces should be Win98 grey (#c0c0c0). No dark theme remnants. Check toolbar, panels, status bar.
    3. Verify SHARP CORNERS: Look at every element — buttons, inputs, panels, minimap. Zero rounded corners anywhere.
    4. Verify INSTANT INTERACTIONS: Hover over toolbar buttons, click them. No fade or transition effects — state changes are instant.
    5. Verify TYPOGRAPHY: Text should appear in MS Sans Serif (or Arial fallback) at 11px. Check toolbar labels, panel headers, status bar.
    6. Verify THEME TOGGLE: Click the theme button in toolbar. It should cycle: Win98 (Standard) → Hi-Con (High Contrast) → Desert → Win98. Colors should change across ALL surfaces and bevels.
    7. Verify CANVAS WELL: The map canvas area should appear sunken into the surface (darker border on top-left, lighter on bottom-right).
    8. Verify NO BROKEN STYLES: No elements with missing backgrounds, invisible text, or broken layouts.
