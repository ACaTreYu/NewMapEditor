  - MapCanvas.tsx: Floating canvas label "WxH (N)" with intelligent edge-aware positioning
  - Fixed 13px font for zoom-independent readability
  - Both displays skip 1x1 single-tile selections
- Verification: PASSED (5/5 must-haves confirmed in codebase)
- Requirements: SEL-01 and SEL-02 marked done in REQUIREMENTS.md
- ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md all updated

- Phase 59: Ruler Tool — Advanced Modes (not yet planned)

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Compact "WxH (N tiles)" format in status bar for space efficiency
- Skip display for 1x1 selections to reduce visual noise
- Fixed 13px font size for zoom-independent readability of floating labels
- Intelligent label positioning: default above-left, fallback right when left-clipped, fallback below when top-clipped

</decisions_made>

<context>
v2.9 milestone is 3/5 phases complete (56, 57 done; 58-60 remaining). Next up is the Ruler Tool which will be a bigger feature — line measurement with click-drag, Manhattan + Euclidean distance display, overlay rendering. It will use the ref-based drag pattern established in v2.8 and the floating label pattern just established in Phase 57.
