<completed_work>

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- No remaining work in v1.0.5
- Next: `/gsd:new-milestone` to plan next milestone
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- 53 GAME_SETTINGS keys in description (HoldingTime is binary-header-only, not 54th key)
- settingsSerializer.ts only imports from GameSettings.ts and types.ts (no circular deps)
- buildDescription ordering: Format=1.1, settings, unrecognized pairs, Author= last
- Shallow copy pattern in saveMap/saveMapAs (mapToSave) to avoid mutating in-memory state
- Removed serializeSettings/parseSettings from MapSettingsDialog imports (unused in dialog body)
</decisions_made>

<context>
The editor is in good shape. Settings lifecycle is fully wired — every map creation, open, and save now produces a complete description with all 53 settings. The user was happy with the fix. Ready to plan whatever comes next.

Start with: `/gsd:new-milestone` to define the next milestone scope. /clear first for fresh context.
