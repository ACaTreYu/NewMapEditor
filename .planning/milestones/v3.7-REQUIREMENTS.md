## v3.7 Requirements

Requirements for v3.7 Sidebar Independence.

### Sidebar Layout

- [x] **SIDE-01**: Minimap remains visible in fixed top-right corner when animations panel is collapsed
- [x] **SIDE-02**: Animations panel can be collapsed/expanded via frame border toggle
- [x] **SIDE-03**: When animations panel is collapsed, editing canvas expands to fill the freed sidebar space
- [x] **SIDE-04**: When animations panel is expanded, current stacked layout preserved (minimap on top, animations below)
- [x] **SIDE-05**: Game object tool panel visibility follows animations panel collapse state

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Floating/draggable minimap | Fixed corner slot, not floating overlay |
| Resizable sidebar width | Fixed 130px works, no resize handle needed |
| Separate minimap resize | Minimap stays at current 128x128 size |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| SIDE-01 | Phase 80 | ✅ Complete |
| SIDE-02 | Phase 80 | ✅ Complete |
