## v1.1.2-linux Requirements

Requirements for Linux port and cross-platform architecture. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Build & Packaging

- [x] **BUILD-01**: App builds as Linux AppImage via electron-builder (tar.gz from Windows; AppImage needs Linux host) -- Shipped as .deb instead of AppImage
- [x] **BUILD-02**: Build scripts organized for cross-platform (win/linux flags, shared config)
- [x] **BUILD-03**: electron-builder config structured for multi-OS targets (separate per-platform overrides)

### Platform Polish

- [x] **PLAT-01**: File paths use XDG conventions on Linux (config, data, cache directories) -- Electron handles XDG natively, documented via getUserDataPath()
- [x] **PLAT-02**: Auto-updater works on Linux via AppImage + latest-linux.yml on GitHub Releases -- Wired but .deb is primary target now
- [x] **PLAT-03**: Platform-conditional code isolated (not scattered process.platform checks)
- [x] **PLAT-04**: Electron menu adjusted for Linux conventions (no App menu, correct accelerators) -- & prefixes on all 5 top-level labels

### Distribution

- [x] **DIST-01**: GitHub Release includes Linux AppImage + latest-linux.yml alongside Windows assets -- Adjusted: .deb distributed via website, not GitHub Releases
- [x] **DIST-02**: Website archive page shows Linux download alongside Windows download
- [x] **DIST-03**: Release workflow docs updated for dual-platform publish process -- Documented in memory/linux-build.md

## Future Requirements

### Additional Platforms

- **PLAT-05**: macOS build (dmg) -- deferred, no current need
- **PLAT-06**: Snap/Flatpak packaging -- deferred, .deb covers most users

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| BUILD-01 | Phase 88 | Complete (shipped as .deb) |
| BUILD-02 | Phase 88 | Complete |
| BUILD-03 | Phase 88 | Complete |
| PLAT-01 | Phase 89 | Complete (Electron XDG native) |
| PLAT-02 | Phase 89 | Complete (wired, .deb primary) |
| PLAT-03 | Phase 88 | Complete |
| PLAT-04 | Phase 89 | Complete |
| DIST-01 | Phase 90 | Complete (adjusted: website, not GitHub) |
| DIST-02 | Phase 90 | Complete |
| DIST-03 | Phase 90 | Complete |

**Coverage:**
- v1.1.2-linux requirements: 10 total
- Shipped: 10 (100%)
- Adjusted: 2 (BUILD-01 AppImage→deb, DIST-01 GitHub→website)
- Dropped: 0

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 10 of 10 requirements
**Adjusted:** BUILD-01 (AppImage → .deb for user-friendliness), DIST-01 (GitHub Releases → website direct download)
**Dropped:** None
