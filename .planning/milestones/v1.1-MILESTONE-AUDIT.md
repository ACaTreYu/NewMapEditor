| Divider drag → Canvas height updates | COMPLETE | Instant transitions, proper constraints |

**Flow Coverage:** 5/5 flows complete (100%)

## Tech Debt

### Minor (Non-Blocking)

**Phase 6: Orphaned RightSidebar Component**
- Location: `src/components/RightSidebar/`
- Impact: Dead code, increases bundle size slightly
- Recommendation: Remove or document as future horizontal layout option

## Human Verification Checklist

Items that cannot be verified programmatically:

### Phase 4: Theming
- [ ] Theme toggle cycles S → L → D correctly
- [ ] No flash of wrong theme on app start (FOUC prevention)
- [ ] System theme detection works
- [ ] Toolbar and Settings dropdown stay in sync

### Phase 5: Scrollbars
- [ ] Arrow buttons highlight on hover/click
- [ ] Single click moves exactly one tile
- [ ] Hold timing feels natural (250ms delay, then smooth)
- [ ] Track click jumps full page
- [ ] 10px scrollbar width is usable

### Phase 6: Collapsible Panels
- [ ] Collapse button visually clear
- [ ] Double-click toggles reliably
- [ ] Drag-to-collapse snap threshold feels right
- [ ] Tab click when collapsed expands + switches
- [ ] Tab bar visible when collapsed

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.1 is ready for completion.**

All 12 requirements satisfied. All 3 phases verified. All 8 cross-phase integrations connected. All 5 E2E flows complete. Only minor tech debt (orphaned component) which can be addressed in future cleanup.
