# Milestone v3.6: Toolbar Icons & Panel Polish

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-16
**Phases:** 79
**Total Plans:** Ad-hoc (2 commits)

## Overview

Replaced generic Lucide icons with game-specific toolbar icons (custom PNG and tileset-rendered), restructured panel layout for better tileset/notepad workflow, added dropdown tile previews for game object tools, and cleaned up UI elements.

## Phases

### Phase 79: Toolbar Icons & Panel Polish

**Goal**: Replace generic Lucide icons with game-specific toolbar icons, restructure panel layout, and clean up UI.
**Depends on**: Phase 78
**Plans**: Ad-hoc (no formal plans)

**Details:**

Toolbar Icons:
- Custom PNG icons for bunker, conveyor, flag, switch tools (user-created assets)
- Tileset-rendered icons for spawn (tile 1100), pole (tile 1361), warp (anim 0x9E center)
- resolveToStaticTile() helper converts animated tile IDs to first-frame static tiles
- 3x3 tile stamp dropdown previews for spawn (Type 1 cross + Type 2 single), flag (per team), pole (per team with distinct center tiles 881/1001/1121/1241)
- Wall type renames: Pattern A -> Brushed Metal, Pattern B -> Carbon Fiber, Block A -> Alt. A, Block B -> Alt. B

Panel Layout:
- Minimap always visible independent of sidebar collapse state
- Tileset panel fixed at 660px width (flex-shrink: 0), notepad fills remaining space (flex: 1)
- Tabbed notepad/measurements panel with auto-switch when ruler measurement pinned
- Layer-style eye icon (LuEye/LuEyeOff) visibility toggle for pinned measurements
- Show/hide all measurements toggle

UI Cleanup:
- Switch tool dropdown removed (no variants needed)
- Animation panel toggle button and "Anim" label removed

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Custom PNG icons for bunker/conveyor/flag/switch (user-created, not auto-generated)
- Tileset-rendered icons for spawn/pole/warp (dynamic, adapts to loaded tileset)
- Per-team pole center tiles (881/1001/1121/1241) distinct from flag receivers
- Fixed tileset panel width (no resize handle) with notepad filling remaining space

**Issues Resolved:**
- Toolbar icons no longer generic Lucide shapes for game-specific tools
- Pole dropdown previews now visually distinct from flag previews
- Notepad panel was hidden by TilePalette flex: 1 override — fixed with flex: 0 0 auto on compact mode

**Issues Deferred:**
- Animated toolbar icons (warp icon could animate) — deferred for complexity

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Old bunker-sedit.png still exists in src/assets/toolbar/ (superseded by bunkericon.png)
