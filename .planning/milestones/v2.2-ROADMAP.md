# Milestone v2.2: Transparency & Performance

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-09
**Phases:** 37
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Eliminate idle CPU usage and startup lag. Fixed tile transparency rendering and optimized performance across all interactions. The app previously re-rendered continuously due to a perpetual animation loop, cascading state syncs, and unscoped canvas redraws. This milestone achieved zero idle work and responsive startup.

## Pre-Phase Feature

### Tile Transparency (commit 4b12583)

- Canvas renders transparent PNG pixels as tile-280 color (black/farplane) instead of grey background
- Tileset panel shows checkerboard pattern behind transparent tile areas
- Multi-tile stamp placement skips tile 280 (empty) to preserve existing map content

## Phases

### Phase 37: Render & State Performance

**Goal**: Eliminate idle CPU usage and reduce re-renders to only what changed
**Requirements**: PERF-01, PERF-02, PERF-03, PERF-04, PERF-05, PERF-06
**Plans:** 3 plans — Verified 6/6

Plans:

- [x] 37-01-PLAN.md — Conditional animation loop + granular state sync
- [x] 37-02-PLAN.md — Canvas layer optimization + selector splitting
- [x] 37-03-PLAN.md — App.tsx cleanup + Minimap defer + verification

**Details:**

**Targets:**
- Animation loop: pause when no animated tiles on screen, pause when window backgrounded
- syncTopLevelFields: eliminate or make granular (only sync changed fields)
- Canvas: split animation redraw from full layer redraw, only redraw what changed
- Selectors: break MapCanvas mega-selector into focused subscriptions
- App.tsx: remove or scope the `map` subscription at root level
- Minimap: defer or offload pixel computation to idle callback / Web Worker

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Animation loop runs continuously but only updates state when tiles visible AND tab active
- Each wrapper action syncs only the fields it modifies, not all 8+ top-level fields
- Document switching (createDocument/setActiveDocument/closeDocument) still uses full sync
- Split 9-field mega-selector into 3 focused groups (tool, paste, selection)
- Actions use individual selectors (stable references, no re-render overhead)
- animFrameRef pattern decouples overlay layer from unconditional animation ticks
- Conditional animation only when selection/paste/conveyor active
- App.tsx event handlers use getState() for one-time reads instead of reactive map subscription
- Minimap tile color cache deferred via requestIdleCallback with 2s timeout fallback
- Map-mutating functions create new MapData wrapper objects ({ ...doc.map }) for selector detection

**Issues Resolved:**

- Map mutations not detected by selectors (critical bug: reusing same doc.map reference broke useShallow detection)
- Pre-existing MapCanvas.tsx variable declaration order blocking typecheck

**Issues Deferred:**

None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None — clean implementation with no shortcuts
