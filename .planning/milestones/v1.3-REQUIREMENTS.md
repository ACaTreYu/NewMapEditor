# Requirements: AC Map Editor v1.3

**Defined:** 2026-02-03
**Core Value:** Professional map editing experience with intuitive layout that maximizes canvas space

## v1.3 Requirements

Requirements for the Layout Fix milestone.

### Layout

- [x] **LAYOUT-01**: Map canvas fills the majority of window space (dominant element, not thin strip) -- Validated: 63.75% viewport
- [x] **LAYOUT-02**: Tileset panel has adequate height to display tiles without excessive scrolling -- Validated: 25% default, minSize 10%
- [x] **LAYOUT-03**: Animation panel has adequate width to display previews clearly -- Validated: 15% default, 120px canvas
- [x] **LAYOUT-04**: Panel dividers are draggable to resize panels -- Validated: col-resize/row-resize cursors
- [x] **LAYOUT-05**: Default panel sizes match SEdit proportions on launch -- Validated: SEdit-like proportions confirmed

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| MDI-style multiple map windows | SEdit supports this but adds significant complexity |
| Floating/detachable panels | Keeping fixed layout for simplicity |
| Panel size persistence | May add later, but focus on correct defaults first |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| LAYOUT-01 | Phase 11 | Complete |
| LAYOUT-02 | Phase 11 | Complete |
| LAYOUT-03 | Phase 11 | Complete |
| LAYOUT-04 | Phase 11 | Complete |
