# Milestone v1.0.2: Bug Fixes & Branding

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-17
**Phases:** 81
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Fix two critical bugs (switch tool placement, animated tile erasure) and add branding (About dialog, splash screen with copyright). Switch tool fails because custom.dat asset is not served from the public path. Animation system has a timing issue where patchAnimatedTiles() re-renders old animated content after a tile has been overwritten with DEFAULT_TILE.

## Phases

### Phase 81: Bug Fixes & Branding

**Goal**: Switch tool places tiles correctly, animated tiles fully erase in one pass, and app has proper branding
**Depends on**: None
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 81-01-PLAN.md — Fix custom.dat path and animated tile erasure bug
- [x] 81-02-PLAN.md — Add Help/About dialog and splash screen branding

**Success Criteria:**
1. User clicks Switch tool on map -> 3x3 tile pattern appears from custom.dat
2. User can place switch at any map location without console errors
3. User drags pencil with DEFAULT_TILE over animated tile -> animation disappears immediately
4. User paints DEFAULT_TILE over conveyor/spawn/warp -> single pass removes all animation
5. Help -> About opens dialog showing copyright, author, and version number
6. App displays splash screen on startup with copyright, author, and version

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Use Set<number> for tracking cleared animated tiles (O(1) lookup in patchAnimatedTiles loop)
- Move custom.dat to public/assets/ (Vite public directory) rather than code-level import
- Electron native dialog for About (simpler than custom React modal)
- In-memory HTML data URL for splash screen (no external file needed)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Switch tool 404 error when loading custom.dat (BUG-01, BUG-02)
- Ghost animation frames when erasing animated tiles during drag (BUG-03)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
