## v1 Requirements

### Settings Format

- [x] **SFMT-01**: User's saved maps always include `Format=1.1,` at the beginning of the extended settings list in the description field
- [x] **SFMT-02**: Settings serialization follows correct ordering: Format=1.1 → non-flagger → flagger → Author → unrecognized pairs
- [x] **SFMT-03**: Maps saved without Format=1.1 (pre-v1.0.4) still load correctly with optional format detection

### Settings Bugs

- [x] **SBUG-01**: User can load any map and see sliders update to match the dropdown values (Very Low through Very High)
- [x] **SBUG-02**: User can adjust Special Damage without it incorrectly changing the Laser Damage slider
- [x] **SBUG-03**: All 54 game settings are validated against SEdit source and AC_Setting_Info_25.txt for correct defaults, ranges, and behavior
- [x] **SBUG-04**: User can load a map and see correct values across all game settings tabs (General, Combat, Weapons, Powerups, Game Rules)

### File Operations

- [x] **FILE-01**: User can select File > Save As from the menu to save a map under a different filename
- [x] **FILE-02**: After Save As, subsequent File > Save writes to the new filename (not the original)
- [x] **FILE-03**: Window title updates to reflect the new filename after Save As

### Animation

- [x] **ANIM-01**: User sees animated tiles rendering on the map canvas even when the animations panel is hidden/collapsed

### Image Trace

- [x] **IMGT-01**: User can import an image file (PNG, JPG, BMP, WebP, SVG, GIF) via the menu
- [x] **IMGT-02**: Imported image appears as an MDI child window on top of the editing canvas
- [x] **IMGT-03**: User can adjust the opacity of the trace image window (0-100%)
- [x] **IMGT-04**: User can move and resize the trace image window
- [x] **IMGT-05**: Trace image window stays always on top of other child windows
- [x] **IMGT-06**: User can edit the map through the trace image (click-through — mouse events pass to canvas below)
