## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future milestone. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Layout Enhancements

### Toolbar Enhancements

- **TOOLBAR-04**: Keyboard shortcuts shown in tooltips (e.g., "Pencil (P)")

### Advanced Features

- **ADV-01**: Collapsible bottom panel (minimize to tab bar only)
- **ADV-02**: Panel collapse to icons (VS Code activity bar pattern)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Floating/dockable panels | Keeping fixed layout for simplicity |
| Custom in-app menu bar | Staying with native Electron menu |
| V2 map format support | Separate concern, not this milestone |
| Tileset selection UI | Separate concern, not this milestone |
| Dark mode / themes | Not requested, can add later |
| Custom keyboard shortcuts | Not requested, can add later |
