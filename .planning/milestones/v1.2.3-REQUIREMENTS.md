Requirements for v1.2.3 Canvas Backgrounds & Fixes milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Canvas Background

- [x] **BG-01**: User can select canvas background mode from toolbar dropdown (5 options)
- [x] **BG-02**: Transparent mode shows no background behind empty tiles (current default behavior)
- [x] **BG-03**: SEdit classic mode fills empty tile areas with SEdit's classic background color
- [x] **BG-04**: Farplane mode renders the current patch's farplane image behind empty tiles
- [x] **BG-05**: Custom color mode lets user pick any solid color as canvas background
- [x] **BG-06**: Custom image mode lets user load any image file as canvas background
- [x] **BG-07**: Background mode persists across sessions via localStorage
- [x] **BG-08**: Background renders correctly during animation ticks (blitDirtyRect path)

### Patch Selector

- [x] **PATCH-01**: Desktop builds show bundled patch dropdown in tileset panel (same as web)
- [x] **PATCH-02**: Patch loading uses IPC-based path resolution for production builds
- [x] **PATCH-03**: Active patch indicated visually in the dropdown

### Wall Tool Fix
