# Milestone v1.6: SELECT & Animation Panel

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-08
**Phases:** 16-20
**Total Plans:** 5

## Overview

Full SELECT tool with SEdit parity (marquee selection, copy/paste/cut/delete, mirror H/V, rotate 90, floating paste preview) and redesigned Animation Panel matching SEdit's vertical hex-numbered list with Tile/Anim mode toggle.

## Phases

### Phase 16: Marquee Selection Foundation

**Goal**: Users can select rectangular regions with marching ants visual feedback
**Depends on**: Phase 15
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 16-01: SELECT tool drag handling + marching ants rendering + Escape cancellation

**Details:**
- SELECT tool creates animated marching ants selection via drag-to-select
- Alternating black/white dashed border using existing animationFrame counter
- Selection stored as tile coordinates (integers) for zoom accuracy
- Escape key cancels active selection
- Selection persists across tool switches

### Phase 17: Clipboard Operations

**Goal**: Users can copy, cut, paste, and delete selected tiles
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 17-01: Clipboard state + actions in EditorState + keyboard shortcuts in ToolBar

**Details:**
- Copy/cut/paste/delete with Ctrl+C/X/V/Delete keyboard shortcuts
- Full undo/redo integration for all clipboard operations
- Selection persists after cut and delete for immediate re-copy workflow
- Pasted region becomes active selection (enables paste-transform workflow)
- Clipboard persists across tool switches

### Phase 18: Floating Paste Preview

**Goal**: Implement floating paste preview for precise clipboard placement with visual feedback
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 18-01: Paste preview state + rendering + interactions

**Details:**
- Ctrl+V triggers semi-transparent floating paste preview
- 70% opacity preview follows cursor position
- Click commits paste, Escape cancels
- Paste preview stored as tile coordinates for zoom accuracy
- Works correctly at all zoom levels (0.25x-4x)

### Phase 19: Mirror/Rotate Transforms

**Goal**: Users can transform clipboard contents with mirror H/V and rotate 90
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 19-01: Transform actions (mirrorH/V, rotate90) + Ctrl+H/J/R keyboard shortcuts

**Details:**
- Ctrl+H horizontal flip, Ctrl+J vertical flip, Ctrl+R 90 rotation
- All transforms preserve full 16-bit tile encoding (animation flags, frame offsets)
- Rotation swaps width/height dimensions for non-square selections
- Ctrl+R overrides Electron reload via preventDefault

### Phase 20: Animation Panel Redesign

**Goal**: Animation panel matches SEdit's vertical hex-numbered list with Tile/Anim mode toggle
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent work)
**Plans**: 1 plan (completed outside GSD as SEdit Visual Parity work)

Plans:
- [x] 20-01: SEdit Visual Parity (narrow 70px panel, hex labels, team selector, auto-select) -- commit b57d8c6

**Details:**
- Narrow 70px SEdit-style animation panel with hex-numbered 00-FF vertical list
- Tile/Anim radio toggle switches between placing static tile vs animated tile
- 27 custom SVG toolbar icons replacing emoji
- Minimap moved to right sidebar above Animations

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Selection stored as tile coordinates (not pixels) for zoom accuracy
- Marching ants use existing animationFrame counter (zero overhead)
- 70% opacity for paste preview (semi-transparent for see-through)
- Ctrl+R for rotate (matches SEdit, overrides Electron reload)
- Copy preserves full 16-bit tile values (animation flags, game objects)
- Selection persists after cut/delete for immediate re-copy workflow
- Basic geometric transforms only (no content-aware rotTbl/mirTbl lookup tables)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Coordinate accuracy at all zoom levels via tile coordinate storage
- Paste preview rendering with correct zoom scaling
- Escape cancellation consistent across all tool operations

**Issues Deferred:**

- Content-aware transforms (rotTbl/mirTbl from SEdit) for directional tiles like conveyors/bridges
- System clipboard integration (internal clipboard sufficient)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- XFRM/ANIM requirements in traceability table still marked "Pending" despite completion (checkbox mismatch)
- Phase 20 completed outside GSD tracking (no SUMMARY.md)
