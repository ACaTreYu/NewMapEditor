# Milestone v1.3: Layout Fix

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-04
**Phases:** 11
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

Fix the panel layout so the map canvas dominates the window like SEdit, with properly sized and draggable panels.

## Phases

### Phase 11: Panel Layout Fix

**Goal**: Fix CSS flexbox sizing issues so canvas dominates window and dividers are draggable
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 11-01: Flexbox min-height fix + proportion verification

**Details:**

**Requirements covered:**
- LAYOUT-01: Map canvas fills majority of window
- LAYOUT-02: Tileset panel adequate height
- LAYOUT-03: Animation panel adequate width
- LAYOUT-04: Panel dividers draggable
- LAYOUT-05: Default sizes match SEdit

**Success criteria:**
1. Map canvas visually dominates the window (>60% of viewport)
2. Tileset panel shows multiple rows of tiles without scrolling on 1080p display
3. Animation panel shows animation previews clearly (not cut off)
4. Dragging panel dividers resizes adjacent panels
5. Fresh app launch shows SEdit-like proportions

**Key changes:**
- Added `min-height: 0` and `min-width: 0` to panel elements (root cause fix)
- Moved animations panel from left to right side (matching SEdit)
- Removed centering constraints so map canvas fills entire panel space
- Fixed animation previews to stay at 16x16 size

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Animations panel moved from left to right side (matching SEdit layout)
- Map canvas fills entire panel space (removed centering constraints)
- Animation previews stay at fixed 16x16 size (no stretching)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Flexbox min-height issue causing panels to not shrink properly
- CSS centering in `.map-window-frame` constraining canvas size
- Animation panel stretching previews beyond 16x16

**Issues Deferred:**

- Panel size persistence to localStorage (low priority)
- Redesign animation panel to match SEdit numbered list style (future milestone)
- Win95/98 theme overhaul (future milestone)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Orphaned exports still present: MapSettingsPanel, TabbedBottomPanel, RightSidebar, AnimationPreview
- Pre-existing TypeScript path alias issues (@components pattern)
