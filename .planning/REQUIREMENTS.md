# Requirements: AC Map Editor

**Defined:** 2026-02-16
**Core Value:** The map editing experience should feel intuitive and professional — tools work correctly, the layout maximizes the editing canvas, and workflows match what users expect from image editors.

## v3.8 Requirements

Requirements for v3.8 Bug Fixes milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Bug Fixes

- [ ] **BUG-01**: Switch tool places correct tile pattern from custom.dat when user clicks on map
- [ ] **BUG-02**: custom.dat file loads successfully on app startup (file served from correct public path)
- [ ] **BUG-03**: Painting DEFAULT_TILE (280) over an animated tile fully erases it in a single pass (no residual animation frames)

## Future Requirements

None for this milestone.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Switch type dropdown UI | Only one switch type exists — no selector needed |
| Custom.dat file picker | Auto-load from assets is sufficient |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| BUG-01 | — | Pending |
| BUG-02 | — | Pending |
| BUG-03 | — | Pending |
