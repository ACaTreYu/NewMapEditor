# Requirements: AC Map Editor

**Defined:** 2026-02-16
**Core Value:** The map editing experience should feel intuitive and professional — tools work correctly, the layout maximizes the editing canvas, and workflows match what users expect from image editors.

## v3.7 Requirements

Requirements for v3.7 Sidebar Independence.

### Sidebar Layout

- [ ] **SIDE-01**: Minimap remains visible in fixed top-right corner when animations panel is collapsed
- [ ] **SIDE-02**: Animations panel can be collapsed/expanded via toolbar toggle button
- [ ] **SIDE-03**: When animations panel is collapsed, editing canvas expands to fill the freed sidebar space
- [ ] **SIDE-04**: When animations panel is expanded, current stacked layout preserved (minimap on top, animations below)
- [ ] **SIDE-05**: Game object tool panel visibility follows animations panel collapse state

## Future Requirements

None currently defined.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Floating/draggable minimap | Fixed corner slot, not floating overlay |
| Resizable sidebar width | Fixed 130px works, no resize handle needed |
| Separate minimap resize | Minimap stays at current 128x128 size |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
