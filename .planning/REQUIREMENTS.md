# Requirements: AC Map Editor v1.3

**Defined:** 2026-02-03
**Core Value:** Professional map editing experience with intuitive layout that maximizes canvas space

## v1.3 Requirements

Requirements for the Layout Fix milestone.

### Layout

- [ ] **LAYOUT-01**: Map canvas fills the majority of window space (dominant element, not thin strip)
- [ ] **LAYOUT-02**: Tileset panel has adequate height to display tiles without excessive scrolling
- [ ] **LAYOUT-03**: Animation panel has adequate width to display previews clearly
- [ ] **LAYOUT-04**: Panel dividers are draggable to resize panels
- [ ] **LAYOUT-05**: Default panel sizes match SEdit proportions on launch

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| MDI-style multiple map windows | SEdit supports this but adds significant complexity |
| Floating/detachable panels | Keeping fixed layout for simplicity |
| Panel size persistence | May add later, but focus on correct defaults first |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| LAYOUT-01 | Phase 11 | Pending |
| LAYOUT-02 | Phase 11 | Pending |
| LAYOUT-03 | Phase 11 | Pending |
| LAYOUT-04 | Phase 11 | Pending |
| LAYOUT-05 | Phase 11 | Pending |
