# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** The map editing experience should feel intuitive and professional — tools work correctly, the layout maximizes the editing canvas, and workflows match what users expect from image editors.
**Current focus:** Phase 61 - Layout Restructure

## Current Position

Phase: 61 of 63 (Layout Restructure)
Plan: Not yet planned
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-13 — Roadmap created for v3.0 Panel Layout & Ruler Notes

Progress: [████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████] 98.4% (91/91 plans shipped from v1.0-v2.9, 3 v3.0 phases pending)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 91
- Average duration: ~33 min per plan
- Total execution time: ~58.11 hours across 19 milestones

**Recent Trend (v2.9):**
- Phase 60 completed with 3 plans (ruler, selection info, grid)
- Ref-based ruler state pattern established
- All measurement modes functional with pin/clear support

*Updated: 2026-02-13*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Phase 60**: Ref-based transient state for ruler (zero React re-renders during measurement)
- **Phase 60**: Click-click AND drag for ruler (both interaction modes supported)
- **Phase 59**: CanvasEngine class pattern (imperative canvas ops bypass React)
- **Phase 59**: Permanent Escape listener (single listener for all drag cancellation)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None at roadmap creation. Phase planning will surface any technical blockers.
