**Core value:** The map editing experience should feel intuitive and professional — tools work correctly, the layout maximizes the editing canvas, and workflows match what users expect from image editors.
**Current focus:** Phase 62 - Ruler Notepad Panel

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Phase 62**: Extract formatMeasurement to shared utility (single source of truth)
- **Phase 62**: Individual Zustand selectors for render optimization (not destructuring)
- **Phase 62**: Hover-reveal delete buttons (clean minimalist UI)
- **Phase 61**: Tile palette constrained to 640px (content-only, borders additional)
- **Phase 61**: Freed space collapses to zero at narrow widths (min-width: 0)
- **Phase 60**: Ref-based transient state for ruler (zero React re-renders during measurement)
- **Phase 60**: Click-click AND drag for ruler (both interaction modes supported)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None at roadmap creation. Phase planning will surface any technical blockers.
