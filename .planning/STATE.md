Recent decisions:
- Use Set for cleared tile tracking (v1.0.2/81-01) — O(1) lookup performance in patchAnimatedTiles loop
- Minimap stays in sidebar column (v3.7) — stacked layout preserves feel
- Frame border toggle for sidebar collapse (v3.7) — user preferred thin strip with chevron over toolbar button
